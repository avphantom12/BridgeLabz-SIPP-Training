# ðŸš€ BridgeLabz-SIPP-Training

Welcome to the **BridgeLabz SIPP Training Repository**!  
This repository is part of the **Skill Innovation Partner Program (SIPP)** by **BridgeLabz**, designed to sharpen your Java and Data Structures skills through structured hands-on learning.

> ðŸ“š The project is divided into **four branches**, each focused on a different core topic in Java development.

## ðŸŒ¿ Branch-wise Learning Modules

| Branch Name           | Focus Area                                                             |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `core-java`            | Java basics: syntax, methods, arrays, control flow, strings            |
| `data-structures`      | Classic DSA topics: linked lists, searching, sorting, stack, queue     |
| `oops-concepts`        | Object-Oriented Programming: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, SOLID |
| `generics-collections` | Java Generics: type safety, wildcards, and basic collection interfaces |
