### 🗓 01 – Class And Object (23 June) 
### 🧠 Concepts:

## 🏛 Class vs 🧱 Object

| CLASS 🏛               | OBJECT 🧱                  |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Blueprint / Template   | Real instance in memory   |
| No memory allocation   | Memory is allocated       |
| Code definition only   | Contains real values      |


🏛 Class – A blueprint defined using the class keyword, containing fields and methods.

💾 Memory – A class doesn't occupy memory until you create an object.

🧱 Object – An instance of a class; holds actual data and uses memory.

🔨 Constructor – Special method that runs when an object is created to initialize it.

🗃 Multiple Objects – You can create many objects from one class; each has its own data.

♻ Garbage Collector – Frees up memory by removing objects no longer in use.

---

### 🗓 02 – Constructor (25 June) 
### 🧠 Concepts:
🏗 A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created.

🧱 Same name as the class – A constructor must have the exact same name as the class.

⚙ No return type – Unlike methods, constructors do not have a return type, not even void.

🔄 Automatically called – Runs automatically when an object is created.

📦 Types of Constructors:

🆕 Default Constructor – No parameters, created automatically if you don’t define any.

🎯 Parameterized Constructor – Accepts parameters to set initial values.

🔁 Constructor Overloading – Multiple constructors with different parameter lists.

🧰 Used to set initial values – Often used to assign values to object fields during creation.

🪞 Can call other constructors – Use this() to call another constructor in the same class.

### 🗓 03 – Keywords (27 June) 
### 🧠 Concepts:
🔑 Keywords in Java are reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the language and cannot be used as identifiers like variable or method names.

class – 🏛 Declares a class.

new – 🆕 Creates a new object.

this – 🪞 Refers to the current object.

super – 🧬 Refers to the parent class.

extends – 🧱 Inherits from a superclass.

implements – 🧩 Implements an interface.

interface – 🎛 Declares an interface.

abstract – 🌀 Declares an abstract class or method.

final – 🔒 Prevents inheritance, method overriding, or variable change.

### 🗓 05 – Inheritence (03 July)
### 🧠 Concepts:
🧬 Inheritance allows one class (subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class (superclass).

🏛 Superclass (Parent Class) – The class whose properties are inherited.

🧱 Subclass (Child Class) – The class that inherits from another class using the extends keyword.

🔁 Reusability – Inheritance promotes code reuse and logical hierarchy.

🎯 Method Overriding – Subclass can redefine superclass methods to change behavior.

🔒 Access Control – protected members can be accessed in subclasses.

🚫 Single Inheritance Only – Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes (but allows it via interfaces).

### 🗓 06 – Encapsulation&Polymorphism (07 July) 
### 🧠 Concepts:
🔐 Encapsulation is the wrapping of data (fields) and methods into a single unit (class), with controlled access using access modifiers.

🔒 Private Variables – Class fields are made private to restrict direct access.

🚪 Public Getters/Setters – Access to private fields is provided via public methods.

🛡 Data Hiding – Prevents external code from modifying internal state directly.

🧱 Class-Level Protection – Encapsulation makes a class self-contained and secure.

🧰 Easier Maintenance – Changes to implementation can be made without affecting outside code.

### 🗓 02 – Stack&Queue (10 July) 
### 🧠 Concepts:
### ⭐ Stack :-

⭐ Use stacks for recursion, backtracking, and nested structures.

⭐ Set proper stack size to avoid memory overflow.

⭐ Always define base cases to prevent infinite recursion.

⭐ Use atomic push/pop in multi-threaded environments.

⭐ Validate stack underflow/overflow before operations.

⭐ Prefer built-in structures like Deque over custom stacks.

⭐ Use an auxiliary stack to track min/max in O(1) time.

### ⭐ Queue :-
⭐ Use queues for FIFO tasks like BFS and scheduling.

⭐ Choose the right queue type: simple, deque, or priority.

⭐ Use thread-safe queues in concurrent environments.

⭐ Always check for underflow/overflow conditions.

⭐ Avoid polling empty queues—use blocking patterns.

⭐ Apply lazy deletion in priority queues for performance.

### 🗓 03 – Sorting (11 July)
### 🧠 Concepts:
### 🔄 Sorting Algorithms : Sorting is the process of arranging data in a specific order
🫧 Bubble Sort: Repeatedly "bubbles" larger elements to the end by swapping adjacent pairs – simple but slow (O(n²)).

✍ Insertion Sort: Inserts each element into its correct place like writing a sorted list by hand – efficient for small/nearly sorted data (O(n²)).

🧩 Merge Sort: Divides the array into pieces and merges them in order – reliable and stable (O(n log n)).

⚡ Quick Sort: Picks a pivot and quickly partitions the array around it – fast and efficient on average (O(n log n), worst O(n²)).

### 🗓 04 – Binary And LinearSearch (15 July) 
### 🧠 Concepts:
### 1. 🔁 Linear Search
it is checks each element one by one until it finds the target.

Use when: The list is unsorted or very small.

### Time Complexity:

🕒 Worst case: O(n)

🟢 Best case: O(1) (if the element is first)

Example: Searching for a name in a random list.

### 2. 🪄 Binary Search
 it is repeatedly divides the sorted array in half to find the target.

Use when: The list is sorted.

### Time Complexity:

⚡ Worst case: O(log n)

🔝 Best case: O(1) (if the element is in the middle)

### 🗓 05 – Big-O-Notation (17 July) 
### 🧠 Concepts:
### ⏱ Runtime Analysis:-
Runtime analysis helps you understand how the performance of an algorithm changes as the size of input grows.

🧮 Time complexity: How many steps an algorithm takes.

📦 Space complexity: How much memory it uses.

### 🅾 Big-O Notation:-
